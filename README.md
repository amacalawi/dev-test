Bookstore Developer Test
===========================

This is a skeleton of a simple site made for you to show us your HTML, CSS & Javascript & PHP
skills. The end goal is to complete a book store site based on the requested db schema file.

1. The program must be written into PHP MVC
	* preferably CodeIgniter
  * You can use any library you want to your code

2. Convert the DB Schema into Mysql DB
  * use the schema as your DB

3. Customers & Books
  * Create a crud functionality for the customer and book's table, based on the given fields.

3. Orders
	* Create a function that will lead us on how to order and will display the total orders too.
